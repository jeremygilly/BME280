# BME280 temperature, pressure, humidity sensor

Update 30 November 2018:
 This project uses the adafruit circuit python BME280 library to measure temperature, pressure, and humidity using a BME280.

It also saves the data locally to the SD card. This reduces writing time when compared to cloud storage.
